# Data Modelling - Apache Cassandra
Hello there, this is a project from the *Nanodegree Data engineer program in Udacity*. I'm glad to present you my final submit.
Here we are a Data Engineer that is helping the analytics team to set an Apache Cassandra database to analyze the user interaction data between the song they listened.
So, we are in charge to data model 3 tables from 3 given queries that are set in the jupyter notebook, and also you have the queries that validate if the data is loaded successfully in the table.

* The approach of this NoSQL problem is that we need to understand the query that we need to then create the table because Apache Cassandre is optimized to fast writes and not to fast reads. So, the approach is query first then create the table per query you need.

* Component of the project:
  - Given query requested and their proper DML SQL.
  - Create table QUERY for each given query.
  - Query for each table created to validet if the table has been populated correctly.
