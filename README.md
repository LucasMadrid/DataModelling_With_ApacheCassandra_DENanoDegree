# DATA MODELLING - Apache Cassandra
Hello there, this is a project from the *Nanodegree Data engineer program in Udacity*. I'm glad to present you my final submit.
Here we are a Data Engineer that is helping the analytics team to set an Apache Cassandra database to analyze the user interaction data between the song they listened.
So, we are in charge to data model 3 tables from 3 given queries that are set in the jupyter notebook, and also you have the queries that validate if the data is loaded successfully in the table.
